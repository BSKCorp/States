# States
Hopefully less issueful successor of the "Nations" Series.

### So... what is "States"?
Similarly to "Nations" (an old FSU module), it has a multi-layer protection system.
In the case of "States", the world is composed of `Chunk -> District -> Municipality -> State`.
Players can create a "Municipality", which depending on (configurable!) size will be called "Hamlet", "Village", "Town" and so on.
The Size also decides how many districts a Municipality can have. There is also the "Village" district type for sub-villages.<br>
**To state clearly, I am not gonna implement any type of "war"/"pvp" into this!**<br>
As some years of server management experience confirm, it's for one hard to have a realistic war in MC, and for other part, if allowing it to be "minecrafty", it will be a mere clicking around with swords, which I do not like.
Another point is.. the current situation on the real world in the past years, I do not really want the same in Minecraft, I could just aswel go and create my own State in the real world? (no joke, I was capable back in the days)

### Why "States" as name? Wasn't the old one good enough?
It maybe was good, but a quick googling shows you this:
```
nation - english
a large aggregate of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language,
inhabiting a particular country or territory.
```
Could too fast lead into having nationalists, or people spending their whole online time arguing about each other's real country's stuff, recreating them, and ... hating each other. Seriously, saw such.
```
state - english
a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government.
e.g. "Germany, Italy, and other European states"
```
Sounds better.

### So no way to hold advantage over others, or annoy hostile people?
Economy, _economy_.
"Companies" will be also a feature which will be added in the future.<br>
And you will be able to setup tolls or banish companies from other States.<br>
_States_ is also using the FSMM currency!
