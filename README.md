# States
Hopefully less issueful successor of the "Nations" Series.

### So... what is "States"?
Similarly to "Nations" (an old FSU module), it has a multi-layer protection system.
In the case of "States", the world is composed of `Chunk -> District -> Municipality -> State`.
Players can create a "Municipality", which depending on (configurable!) size will be called "Hamlet", "Village", "Town" and so on.
The Size also decides how many districts a Municipality can have. There is also the "Village" district type for sub-villages.<br>
**To state clearly, I am not gonna implement any type of "war"/"pvp" into this!**<br>
As some years of server management experience confirm, it's for one hard to have a realistic war in MC, and for other part, if allowing it to be "minecrafty", it will be a mere clicking around with swords, which I do not like.

On other side, I'm pretty tired by all that's happening on the "real" world in the recent years, expecially since it's the age of "information", one is overloaded with the amount of data, which additionally is biased or faked. The more if one understands multiple languages it's far beyond a headache seeing how news stations in any country state things completely differently.
I do not want that in Minecraft, I had such a server already in the past. _Kill it before it lays eggs!_

### Why "States" as name? Wasn't the old one good enough?
It maybe was good, but a quick googling shows you this:
```
nation - english
a large aggregate of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language,
inhabiting a particular country or territory.
```
That could fastly lead into having nationalists, people spending their whole online time arguing about each other's real country's stuff, recreating them, and eventually... hating each other. Seriously, I did see such.
```
state - english
a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government.
e.g. "Germany, Italy, and other European states"
```
Sounds better.

### So no way to hold advantage over others, or annoy hostile people?
Economy, _economy_.
"Companies" will be also a feature which will be added in the future.<br>
And you will be able to setup tolls or banish companies from other States.<br>
_States_ is also using the FSMM currency!
